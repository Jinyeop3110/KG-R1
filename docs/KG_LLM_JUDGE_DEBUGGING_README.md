# KG-LLM-Judge Evaluation System: Debugging and Enhancement

## Project Overview

This document chronicles the comprehensive debugging and enhancement work performed on the Knowledge Graph-augmented LLM Judge evaluation system, specifically for MultiTQ temporal reasoning datasets. The work focused on resolving critical alignment issues, simplifying answer extraction, and adding comprehensive debugging capabilities.

## 🎯 Objectives

The primary goals of this debugging session were:

1. **Fix Answer Extraction**: Simplify the complex answer extraction algorithm to use only `<answer>` tag parsing
2. **Resolve Alignment Issues**: Fix severe question-answer-ground truth misalignment across batch processing
3. **Update Prompt Engineering**: Improve MultiTQ prompt augmentation with real actor role examples
4. **Dataset Regeneration**: Convert temporal-specific prompts to standard KG prompt format
5. **Add Comprehensive Debugging**: Implement detailed workflow logging to trace the complete evaluation pipeline

### Key Files Modified

- **`prompt_augmentation_kg.py`** - MultiTQ prompt engineering
- **`multitq_search_augmented_initial_entities.py`** - Dataset generation script
- **`test_multitq_256samples_llm_judge.sh`** - Evaluation execution script

## 🔧 Major Issues Resolved

### 1. Answer Extraction Simplification

**Problem**: Complex 120-line answer extraction algorithm with multiple fallback strategies causing inconsistencies.

**Solution**: Simplified to 25-line implementation using only `<answer>` tag parsing:

```python
def extract_answer_from_response(self, raw_response: str) -> str:
    """Extract answer using only <answer> tags for consistency."""
    import re
    
    # Remove information blocks
    cleaned_str = re.sub(r'<information>.*?</information>', '', raw_response, flags=re.DOTALL)
    
    # Find answer tags
    answer_pattern = r'<answer>(.*?)</answer>'
    matches = re.findall(answer_pattern, cleaned_str, re.DOTALL)
    
    return matches[0].strip() if matches else ""
```

**Impact**: Eliminated inconsistent answer parsing and aligned with standard KG evaluator behavior.

### 2. Critical Alignment Bug Fixes

**Problem**: Question-answer-ground truth misalignment due to inconsistent indexing across batch expansions.

**Root Cause**: Using expanded index `i` instead of original index `original_idx = i // n_rollout_eval` for ground truth access.

**Solution**: Pre-extracted all questions and ground truths before batch transformations:

```python
# Extract from ORIGINAL test_batch before .pop() operation
for i in range(batch_size):
    # Extract question from original prompt
    input_ids = test_batch.batch["input_ids"][i]
    question = self.extract_question_from_kg_prompt(prompt_text)
    
    # Extract ground truth from original reward_model
    reward_info = test_batch.non_tensor_batch['reward_model'][i]
    ground_truth_entities = reward_info['ground_truth']['target_text']
    
    original_questions.append(question)
    original_ground_truths.append(ground_truth_entities)

# Store in meta_info for later access
final_test_batch.meta_info['original_questions'] = original_questions
final_test_batch.meta_info['original_ground_truths'] = original_ground_truths
```

**Impact**: Eliminated question-answer misalignment that was causing evaluation failures.

### 3. Prompt Augmentation Enhancement

**Problem**: Using fake or incorrect MultiTQ actor role examples in prompt augmentation.

**Solution**: Updated with real actor roles from actual MultiTQ knowledge graph data:

```python
Examples of entities:
- Actor roles: "Protester (Egypt)", "Police (Philippines)", "Citizen (Greece)", 
  "Social Worker (India)", "Criminal (Australia)", "Defense Attorney (Iraq)",
  "Men (India)", "Military (New Zealand)", "Armed Rebel (Russia)",
  "Business (Iran)", "Children (Philippines)"
```

**Changes Made**:
- Changed "temporal entities" → "entities"
- Changed "temporal relations" → "relations"  
- Added support for multiple answers
- Updated hint language for clarity

### 4. Dataset Regeneration

**Problem**: Temporal-specific prompts incompatible with standard KG evaluation framework.

**Solution**: Regenerated dataset with standard KG prompt format:

```python
def create_multitq_kg_prompt(question: str) -> str:
    """Create standard KG prompt for MultiTQ (same format as other datasets)"""
    
    prompt = (
        "Answer the given question. You must conduct reasoning inside <think> and </think> first "
        "every time you get new information. After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, "
        "you can query the knowledge graph by using <kg-query> function_name(arguments) </kg-query>, "
        "and it will return the top query results between <information> and </information>. "
        "You can query as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, "
        "you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer> without detailed "
        f"illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: {question}"
    )
```

**Result**: Successfully generated 1K sample dataset with standard prompts verified to work across evaluation modes.

### 5. Comprehensive Debug Logging

**Problem**: Previous debug code wasn't appearing in evaluation logs, making troubleshooting impossible.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive `[KG-LLM-JUDGE WORKFLOW]` logging throughout the entire pipeline:

#### Batch Analysis Phase
```python
print(f"[KG-LLM-JUDGE WORKFLOW] ========== BATCH ANALYSIS ==========")
print(f"[KG-LLM-JUDGE WORKFLOW] Responses tensor shape: {responses_shape}")
print(f"[KG-LLM-JUDGE WORKFLOW] Original batch size: {original_batch_size}")
print(f"[KG-LLM-JUDGE WORKFLOW] Effective samples to evaluate: {effective_samples}")
```

#### Sample Processing Phase
```python
print(f"[KG-LLM-JUDGE WORKFLOW] ========== PROCESSING SAMPLE {i} ==========")
print(f"[KG-LLM-JUDGE WORKFLOW] ✅ Question from pre-extracted: '{question}'")
print(f"[KG-LLM-JUDGE WORKFLOW] ✅ Predicted answer: '{predicted_answer}'")
print(f"[KG-LLM-JUDGE WORKFLOW] ✅ Ground truth: {ground_truth_entities}")
```

#### LLM Judge Interaction Phase
```python
print(f"[KG-LLM-JUDGE WORKFLOW] === CALLING LLM JUDGE FOR TASK {task['index']} ===")
print(f"[KG-LLM-JUDGE] GPT Response: {response_text}")
print(f"[KG-LLM-JUDGE WORKFLOW] === LLM JUDGE RESPONSE: {binary_vector} ===")
```
